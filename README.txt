Instructions on How to Run this Program.

Interpreter: Python 3.7

In order to execute this program, please type in the command below through your terminal / bash in the directory where the file is:
python3 implementation2.py

Description:
This program performs Online Perceptron, Average Perceptron and Polynomial Kernel Perceptron Algorithm.

Pre-Processing:
- Turning the Y-Variable (our prediction value - label) as +1 and -1 for values equal to 3 and 5.
- Add bias (1) as the first column 
- Separate X and Y values

Please find the step by step description of each algorithm:
- Performs 15 iterations and calculate accuracy for Online Perceptron Algorithm per iteration for both training and validation data
- Plot the Accuracy vs Iterations for both training and validation data
- Predict Y-values (label) as +1 or -1 based on the validation data accuracy and set of features in the test file

Additional for Kernel Perceptron:
- Plot best validation accuracy vs polynomial degrees p
